            <h3 class="faq-question">Is this just an SEO audit with a different label?</h3>
            <p class="faq-answer">No. A DCS Audit includes SEO and schema, but it also evaluates conversion, trust, analytics, and governance. The output is designed to support executive decisions about whether to optimize, rebuild, or re-platform your site.</p>
          </article>
          <article class="faq-item">
            <h3 class="faq-question">Can my current agency or developer use this audit?</h3>
            <p class="faq-answer">Yes. The audit is vendor-neutral. Many clients choose to execute the roadmap with their existing teams; others ask NexTara to own the rebuild. Either way, you keep the score, the findings, and the documentation.</p>
          </article>
          <article class="faq-item">
            <h3 class="faq-question">What if my score is already high?</h3>
            <p class="faq-answer">If your score is already in the DCS 880–920 range, the audit focuses on unlocking specific opportunities: AI visibility, conversion lift, and governance hardening. The goal is to move you from &quot;strong&quot; to &quot;enterprise-ready&quot; with a clear, prioritized set of changes.</p>

            <h3 class="faq-question">Will you try to sell me a full website rebuild?</h3>
            <p class="faq-answer">Only if the data justifies it. The DCS Audit is designed to answer a single question: &quot;Can this website realistically operate as a DCS 900+ asset?&quot; If the answer is yes, the roadmap will focus on optimization instead of rebuild.</p>
